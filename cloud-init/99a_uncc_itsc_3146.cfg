  NoCloud:
    # The following location:
    #
    # - Must have begin with 'file:///' (or possibly '/'?) even though
    #   documentation suggests 'file://'
    #
    # - Must contain a meta-data and a user-data file.
    #   Any user-data overrides vendor-data.
    #   Files may be empty, but if so, they have to be completely empty of chars.
    #
    # Note: Lima adds its own 'cidata' volume (mounted at /mnt/lima-cidata),
    #       containing meta-data, user-data, and network-config.
    #       Cloud-init will replace files from datasource cfg's seedfrom dir
    #       with the cidata volume's files, if they exist (so it keeps
    #       our vendor-data).
    #       (see https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/blob/main/cloudinit/sources/DataSourceNoCloud.py#L131)
